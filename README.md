# Notes: They are closed from JUNE 28th to JULY 7th


TODO:
1. DONE: ~Change the banner: to say would you like to add funds now;~
2. Can we make adding funds directly from the measuring screen
3. List all the temperatures as individual check boxes. [easy] (TEMPERATURES --> 1 BISQUE, 1 GLAZE, 1 LUSTER)
  student could select bisque and glaze or just one. Or they could do bisque, glaze, luster all at one time? The none option is a little confusing to some and the paying for one vs two firings has a split jury.
  only use: “Bisque (Δ 06)” instead of the current “Δ 06 (Cone 06)” the difference between cone 06 and 6 trips up some of our newer students
  b. This may not be easy for luster
4. Alter the measure screen:
…
handles___
Do you need firing slips for pieces with identical dimensions and tempertures? Qty: Default 1
Total___
temperature
[remove class #]
add text  “Don’t forget your class chip.”
5. DONE: ~red font the message when something is messed up upon submission (like “measurement cannot exceed 22”)~
6. on web app add the “add firing” to the drop down.
7. DONE: ~back end: can we fix the button on the "add credit" page that only shows the top half?~
8. If we have the Menu, we sort of don't need the homepage. Homepage could be the measuring form, and then you push Menu for everything else?If homepage is the measure a piece page, we have him change the top to "this is you balance__. add fundshere".  regardless of if you are under 25
9. DONE: ~Add Robots.txt~
